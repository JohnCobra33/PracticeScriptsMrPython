"The application generates a random number from 1 to 100. Then, it prompts for guesses and responds whether the number to guess is greater or smaller than the input, along with the remaining attempts (you have 10 attempts to guess it). The program ends when the correct number is guessed (also telling you how many attempts it took), or if the maximum number of attempts is reached, it reveals the generated number."
